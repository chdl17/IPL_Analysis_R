# IPL_Analysis_R
This repository contains R code and a Kaggle dataset for analyzing Indian Premier League (IPL) game data. The IPL is a professional Twenty20 cricket league in India, and is one of the most popular cricket leagues in the world.

The dataset includes information on matches played from 2008 to 2020, including details on teams, players, and performance statistics. The R code in this repository provides examples of how to analyze and visualize this data, such as exploring team performance over time and analyzing player statistics.

To use this repository, you will need to have R and R Studio installed on your computer. You can download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the same directory as the R code. Then, you can open the R code in R Studio and run the code chunks to see the results.

In this repository, you will find different R scripts to perform Data Exploration, Data Cleaning, Data Visualization, and building a predictive model to predict the winner of a match.

Please note that this is just a sample project and the dataset is not updated. The analysis and model might not be accurate since the dataset is not reflecting the most recent data.

I hope you find this repository useful for your own IPL data analysis projects. Happy coding!
